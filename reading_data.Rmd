Testing the example request: read as a JSON file and write in a .csv file

```{r}

json_file <- 'http://aircasting.org/api/sessions.json?page=0&page_size=4000&q[measurements]=true&q[time_from]=0&q[time_to]=1552648500&q[location]=NewYork&q[sensor_name]=AirBeam-PM&q[unit_symbol]=µg/m³'

air_beam_mobile <- fromJSON(json_file) 

write.csv(air_beam_mobile, './data/air_beam_mobile.csv')


```

Questions to discuss:
1. Do we need to specify everything in the customized link?
2. If we do, is there a list of all the options available to plug in the link?

Testing: session id, using example request

Question:
Which id should we use?


test fixed sesssions
```{r}
test_fixed <- 'http://aircasting.org/api/realtime/sessions.json?page=0&page_size=50&q[measurements]=true&q[time_from]=0&q[time_to]=1552648500&&q[location]=NewYork&q[sensor_name]=AirBeam-PM&q[unit_symbol]=µg/m³'

fromJSON(test_fixed)

```



```{r}

json_file2 <- 'http://aircasting.org/api/realtime/sessions.json?page=0&page_size=1000&q[measurements]=true&q[time_from]=0&q[time_to]=1439&q[day_from]=0&q[day_to]=355&q[location]=NewYork&q[sensor_name]=AirBeam-PM&q[unit_symbol]=µg/m³'

air_beam_mobile2 <- fromJSON(json_file2)


```


Testing: stream measurements
Question: 
1. What are the measurements?
2. Is there an effective way to convert the date?
